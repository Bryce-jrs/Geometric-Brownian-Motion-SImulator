# Geometric Brownian Motion Simulator

This project is a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) simulator implemented in Java using Gradle as the build tool. It generates GBM paths and displays them on a line chart, along with a histogram showing the distribution of final values.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- Gradle

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java and Gradle installed on your system.
2. Build the project by running the following command in the project directory:
3. Run the application using the following command:


## Usage

1. Enter the desired parameter values in the input fields on the left side of the application.
2. Click the "Start Simulation" button to generate the GBM paths and histogram.
3. The line chart on the center of the application will display the GBM paths.
4. The histogram below the line chart will show the distribution of final values.
